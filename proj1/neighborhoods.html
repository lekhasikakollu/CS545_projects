		<li>Baixa :  The business district of Lisbon, Baixa contains much Pombaline-style architecture. Many major Portuguese banks are headquartered here. Running south, the main street of Baixa separates Praça do Comércio from the Rossio. A triumphal arch leads from the square to Rua Augusta, lined with many clothing stores. The two most important streets of Baixa are Rua da Prata (Street of Silver) and Rua Áurea. Silversmiths and goldsmiths are located on these streets. </li>
		<li>Chiado: If you head west from Baixa, you'll enter this shopping district. From its perch on a hill, it's traversed by Rua Garrett, named for the noted romantic writer João Batista de Almeida Garrett (1799-1854). Many of the finest shops in the city, such as the Vista Alegre, a china and porcelain house, are here. One coffee house in particular, A Brasileira, has been a traditional gathering spot for the Portuguese literati. </li>
		<li>Bairro Alto : You'll arrive at the Bairro Alto (Upper City). This sector, reached by trolley car, occupies one of the legendary seven hills of Lisbon. Many of its buildings were left fairly intact by the 1755 earthquake. Containing much of the charm and color of the Alfama, it's the location of some of the finest fado (meaning "fate" and describing a type of music) clubs in Lisbon, as well as excellent restaurants and bars. There are also antiques shops. Regrettably, many of the side streets at night are peopled with drug dealers and addicts, so be duly warned.</li>
		<li>The Alfama : To East of Praça do Comércio lies the oldest district, the Alfama.On the way to the Alfama, on Rua dos Bacalhoeiros, stands another landmark, the Casa dos Bicos (House of the Pointed Stones), an early-16th-century town house whose facade is studded with diamond-shape stones. Be careful of muggers in parts of the Alfama at night.</li>
		<li>Cacilhas : On the south side of the Tagus, where puce-colored smoke billows from factory stacks, is the left-bank settlement of Cacilhas. Inhabited mainly by the working class, it's often visited by right-bank residents who come here for the seafood restaurants. You can reach the settlement by way of a bridge or a ferryboat from Praça do Comércio.</li>
